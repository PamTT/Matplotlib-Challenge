# Matplotlib-Challenge
#Taking what I've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset :Mpuse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv
  #1) Clean the data by checking  for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.

  #2) Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps.

      #2.1) Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

      #2.2) Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
